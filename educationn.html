                <p><ul>

                  <li>2 You may need to pay for your adopted pet to be spayed or neutered before bringing him or her home.</li>
                  <li>3 Some expenses are mandatory for all pets, including:
            
                    <li>*Food</li>

                      <li>1 What do you expect your pet to contribute to your life?</li>
                      <li>2 If you are thinking of adopting a young animal, do you have the time and patience to work with the pet through its adolescence?</li>
                      <li>3 Have you considered your lifestyle carefully and determined whether a younger or older animal would be a better match for you?</li>
                      <li>4 Can you train and handle a pet with behavior issues or are you looking for an easy-going friend?</li>
                      <li>5 Do you need a pet who will be reliable with children or one you can take with you when you travel?</li>

                <h1 class="title"> Time Considerations:</h1>
                <p><ul>
                  <li>1 Pets need to be fed two to three times a day, more often in the case of puppies, and need a constant supply of fresh water.</li>
                  <li>2 A responsible pet parent should spend at least one hour per day giving direct attention to his or her pet. 
                    This may include training, exercising, grooming, and playing or, with cats, may just be lap time on the couch.
                     Dogs will need to be taken out to potty several times a day.</li>
                   <li>3 A pet with an abundance of energy needs more time to exercise and interactive toys to keep them entertained</li>
                   <li>3 Pets with long coats need 20 minutes a day of grooming to prevent matting.</li>
                  </ul></p>
